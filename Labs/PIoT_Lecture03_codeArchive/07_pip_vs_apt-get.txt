pip is used to download and install packages directly from PyPI. 
PyPI is hosted by Python Software Foundation. 

It is a specialized package manager that only deals with python packages. 
apt-get is used to download and install packages from Ubuntu repositories 
which are hosted by Canonical.

Automatic update notifications, other apt-installed packages that need 
those tools know they're installed, etc.

With pip, you know you're getting the latest version at the time you install it, 
you can install to a non-default version of Python, and you can install to a virtualenv.

If you don't need any of the features pip gives you, and you don't routinely 
have to install other Python packages which aren't available over APT, 
use the APT versions.

apt-get is pre-compiled, which installs much faster than pip. (sometimes)
